A soil-plant-atmosphere model based on MAESTRA and SPA
===================================================
## Branch
This is the official branch of the version of the MAESPA model used in the research article from Vezy et al. (2018)

## Compilation
Compiles with:
* Intel Visual Fortran Compiler (version >10).
* gfortran

A Makefile is provided to compile Maes* on a Mac (thanks to Martin de Kauwe and Alejandro Morales).

## Informations and Technical manual
* All informations about MAESPA can be found in the [MAESPA website](http://maespa.github.io)
* Further informations on how to modify the input files for this version on the wiki from the unofficial [Gitlab repository](https://gitlab.com/VEZY/MAESPA/wikis/home)
* The [exact version](https://gitlab.com/VEZY/MAESPA) used in Vezy et al. (2018). Carefull, this version is a development version and is not in full agreement with the MAESPA development guidelines (e.g. modified input call for distributed computation). The official, clean, deployed version is the one from repository.
