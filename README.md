A soil-plant-atmosphere model based on MAESTRA and SPA
===================================================

[See this website for a full description of Maespa](http://maespa.github.io)
  
## Branch

This is the master branch of the Maespa model (a compiled version is available for download from the link above),
corresponding to the version of Duursma and Medlyn (2012, with many smaller changes).

See the branch 'Vezy_et_al_2018' for the version published in Vezy et al. (2018), which includes a much improved energy balance routine (and more improvements).

## Compilation

Compiles with:
* Intel Visual Fortran Compiler (version >10). 
* gfortran

A Makefile is provided to compile Maespa on Mac / Linux (thanks to Martin de Kauwe and Alejandro Morales).
